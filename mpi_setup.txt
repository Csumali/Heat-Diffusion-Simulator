The process for setting it up to run the first time for each user is
cumbersome.  After the initial user set-up it works well without much
fuss.

# login as self

# Need to be able to ssh without a password to other machines in
# order to use MPICH.
# run setup_mpi_cluster.sh. this creates ssh-keygen under ./.shh 
./setup_mpi_cluster.sh

# The first time a new host is added to the first "ring"; it needs to be
# established by a "yes" response to "continue connecting".  Every time the
# output hangs, type "yes".

# Note that setup_mpi_cluster.sh must have created this ring but just
# in case login each remote machine to check if you no longer need to type
# anythings to get there.

ssh cssmpi1h
ssh cssmpi2h
ssh cssmpi3h
ssh cssmpi4h
ssh cssmpi5h
ssh cssmpi6h
ssh cssmpi7h
ssh cssmpi8h

# make file .mpd.conf  
vi/emacs/pico .mpd.conf    

# in it write one line:
secretword=<secretword>

# where <secretword> is a secure key you create but not your normal password
# save the file

# set the correct permissions on this file (other permissions won't work)
chmod 600 .mpd.conf

# create the mpd.hosts file in your home directory. The file should
include a list of cssmpi machines as seen in /home/NETID/css434/lab2/mpd.hosts:
cssmpi2h
cssmpi3h
cssmpi4h

Note that you should not include cssmpi1h where you are logging in.

# edit .bash_profile file as follows:

export PATH=/usr/apps/mpich121-`uname -p`/bin:$PATH
export JAVAPATH=/usr/java/latest
export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/usr/apps/mpiJava-`uname -p`/lib/classes:.
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/apps/mpiJava-`uname -p`/lib
export PATH=/usr/apps/mpiJava-`uname -p`/src/scripts:$JAVAPATH/bin:$PATH

# either relogin or type at the command line:
source .bash_profile

# test that your set-up works on the current host
mpd &
mpiexec -n 1 /bin/hostname
mpdallexit

# if you get an error or warning this is a problem.  
# You should get the hostname of your current host

CSSmpdboot -n 4 -v
mpdallexit

# Note that, if you want to use all 8 machines, you have to list 7
# machine names in your ~/mpd.hosts file. Then, type

CSSmpdboot -n 8 -v
mpdallexit

# Now, you are ready to run a mpiJava program.
To compile:
javac *.java

# to run 
CSSmpdboot -n #cpus -v
mpirun -n #cpus java Hello
mpirun -n #cpus java MatrixMult size
mpirun -n #cpus java MyProgram

# for your convenience, java_mpirun.sh is provided, but HW2 should be 
# executed directly with mpirun, (because of too many arguments.)
./java_mpirun #cpus Hello
./java_mpirun #cpus MatrixMult size
./java_mpirun #cpus MyProgram

# to stop
mpdallexit
